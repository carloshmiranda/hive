# Briefing

> **Read this first.** This is the current state of Hive, updated by all tools (Claude Chat, Claude Code, orchestrator). It answers: where are we, what just happened, what's next.
>
> **Update protocol:** Append to the "Recent context" section whenever you make a decision, finish a feature, or learn something important. Trim entries older than 2 weeks to the Archive section at the bottom.

## Current State

- **Phase:** Event-driven migration complete. Ready for first agent dispatch.
- **Architecture:** 7 agents, event-driven, zero crons (except sentinel every 4h). Mac not required.
- **Production URL:** https://hive-phi.vercel.app
- **Active companies:** 0
- **Companies to import:** VerdeDesk (MVP on Vercel), Flolio (growth phase, import later)

### Agent Architecture (7 agents)

| Agent | Runtime | Trigger | Scope |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| CEO | GitHub Actions + Claude | Payments, cycle completions, gates, PRs, directives | Plan, review, score, kill |
| Scout | GitHub Actions + Claude | Pipeline low, CEO requests, company killed | Ideas, market research, SEO keywords |
| Engineer | GitHub Actions + Claude | Features, bugs, Ops escalation, new companies | Code, deploy, scaffold, fix |
| Evolver | GitHub Actions + Claude | Cycle threshold, failure rate | Prompt analysis + improvement |
| Ops | Vercel serverless + Groq | Deploys, sentinel, agent failures | Health check, metrics, error detect |
| Growth | Vercel serverless + Gemini | Scout research delivered, sentinel (stale content) | Blog, SEO, social content |
| Outreach | Vercel serverless + Gemini | Scout leads found, sentinel (stale leads) | Prospects, cold email, follow-up |

### Execution Model

- **Events**: Stripe payments, deploys, GitHub issues/PRs → trigger agents directly
- **Chains**: Agent A finishes → dispatches Agent B via `repository_dispatch`
- **Data conditions**: Sentinel queries Neon every 4h → dispatches agents whose work conditions are met

- **Blocked on:**
  - Resend domain verification (need a real domain — Flolio's domain could work)
  - Gemini + Groq API keys (free, need to register)
  - First Scout run to generate 3 business proposals (trigger via GitHub Actions → Run workflow)

## Recent Context

> Most recent first. Each entry has a source tag: `[chat]` = Claude Chat brainstorming, `[code]` = Claude Code session, `[orch]` = orchestrator, `[carlos]` = manual.

### 2026-03-19 [code] Event-driven architecture migration (ADR-011 + ADR-012)
Migrated from Mac launchd nightly loop to fully event-driven GitHub Actions. 10 agents consolidated to 7 (migration 003). Created 4 brain workflows (hive-ceo.yml, hive-scout.yml, hive-engineer.yml, hive-evolver.yml) + sentinel (hive-sentinel.yml). Updated worker-agents.yml to remove all schedule triggers. Added repository_dispatch to Stripe webhook. Ops escalation chains to Engineer. Secrets set: CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, GH_PAT, DATABASE_URL. orchestrator.ts now fallback only.

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Critical schema fixes found during codebase review
Full 78-file cross-reference found 7 issues that would crash the orchestrator on first real run: agent_actions.cycle_id/company_id were NOT NULL but Idea Scout, Healer, and Provisioner insert with NULL; agent CHECK constraint was missing 4 agent names (outreach, research_analyst, healer, orchestrator); approvals gate_type CHECK was missing 4 types (outreach_batch, vercel_pro_upgrade, social_account, first_revenue); settings table not in schema.sql; middleware didn't exclude /api/agents. Migration 002 fixes all of these. MISTAKES.md entry #13 captures the prevention rule.

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Worker agent dispatch system built
Vercel serverless endpoint (`/api/agents/dispatch`) + GitHub Actions scheduler (`.github/workflows/worker-agents.yml`). Worker agents (Growth, Outreach, Ops) now run independently of the Mac-based nightly loop. Growth: 3x/day, Ops: 4x/day, Outreach: daily. Each dispatch reads full context from Neon, calls Gemini or Groq, writes results back. €0 additional cost. Needs CRON_SECRET in both Vercel env vars and GitHub Actions secrets.

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Cross-company learning architecture (ADR-010)
Decided: multi-repo, not monorepo. Each company keeps its own GitHub repo. Hive coordinates via shared Neon DB. Three mechanisms: (1) Provisioner injects playbook + pitfalls into new company CLAUDE.md, (2) Healer cross-correlates errors across companies before fixing, (3) Venture Brain creates cross-pollination directives. Polsia (comparable system, 1,100+ companies) uses the same pattern.

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Idea Scout rewritten — 3 proposals per batch
Now generates exactly 3 ideas: 1 Portuguese market, 1 Global, 1 best-pick. Each gets its own approval gate. Rejected ideas auto-killed. Scouting triggers when pipeline < 3 companies (not weekly anymore).

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Company priority sorting
New companies (0 cycles) first, struggling companies (lowest CEO score) next, oldest as tiebreaker. Nightly loop reordered: Scout → Provision → Imports → Company cycles → Self-heal → Brain → Evolver → Digest.

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Multi-provider model routing (ADR-009)
Brain agents (CEO, Idea Scout, Research, Venture Brain, Healer, Evolver) on Claude CLI. Workers (Growth, Outreach) on Gemini free tier. Ops on Groq. Engineer always Claude (needs cwd). Fallback: Gemini → Groq → Claude. Need `gemini_api_key` + `groq_api_key` in settings.

### 2026-03-19 [chat] Email domain fix
`hive-phi.vercel.app` can't have DNS records (Vercel-owned). Old code used fake `@hive.local` addresses — removed. Test mode: `onboarding@resend.dev` for digest to Carlos. Production: need real domain in Resend. Flolio's domain could work — Carlos to confirm domain name and where nameservers are hosted.

### 2026-03-18 [chat] Full Hive architecture designed and built
76 files, 21 pages, 9 ADRs. Dashboard, orchestrator, 7 agent prompts, self-healing, provisioning, imports, outreach pipeline. Deployed to Vercel.

## What's Next (in priority order)

1. **Register Gemini + Groq free API keys** — takes 2 min each, enables worker dispatch
2. **Test CEO agent** — GitHub Actions → "Hive CEO" → Run workflow (manual dispatch)
3. **Test Scout agent** — GitHub Actions → "Hive Scout" → Run workflow (mode: ideas)
4. **Resolve email domain** — confirm Flolio's domain, add Resend DNS records, set `sending_domain`
5. **Import VerdeDesk** — via dashboard import dialog, triggers onboarding + pattern extraction
6. **Add GH_PAT to Vercel env** — `npx vercel env add GH_PAT production` (for Stripe → repository_dispatch)

## Open Questions

- What's the Flolio domain? Can we add a `hive.` subdomain to it in Resend?
- When to import Flolio? (Carlos said "later" — growth phase, more complex)
- Target for first revenue? Timeline expectations for first company?

## How to Pick Up Context in Any Claude Session

**The single URL that catches any Claude up:**
```
https://hive-phi.vercel.app/api/briefing
```

### In a new Claude Chat session:
Tell Claude: "Fetch https://hive-phi.vercel.app/api/briefing and read it — that's my project context."
Claude will web_fetch it and instantly know: what companies exist, what's pending, what broke, what was recently decided, and what's next.

### In Claude Code CLI:
At the start of a session:
```bash
curl -s https://hive-phi.vercel.app/api/briefing | jq .
```
Or just read BRIEFING.md from disk (it's in the repo root).

### Writing context back:
From any tool, POST to the context API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://hive-phi.vercel.app/api/context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"chat","category":"decision","summary":"Decided X because Y","detail":"Full reasoning..."}'
```

### What the briefing endpoint returns:
- Current state (active companies, pipeline, pending approvals, configured/missing settings)
- Recent context log (last 20 entries from all tools)
- Health (recent errors)
- Performance (cycle scores)
- Knowledge (top playbook entries)
- Links to key repo files
