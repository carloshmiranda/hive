# Ruflo Smart Routing (pasted by Carlos)

Smart routing skips expensive LLM calls when possible. Simple edits use WASM (free), medium tasks use cheaper models. This can extend your Claude Code usage by 250% or save significantly on direct API costs.

| Complexity | Handler | Speed |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Simple | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms |
| Medium | Haiku/Sonnet | ~500ms |
| Complex | Opus + Swarm | 2-5s |
